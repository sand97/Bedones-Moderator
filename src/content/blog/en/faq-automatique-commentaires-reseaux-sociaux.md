## Why an Automatic FAQ is Essential in Africa

With 8.4 million Facebook users in Côte d'Ivoire and 6.17 million in Cameroon, the same questions come back hundreds of times per day. An automatic FAQ ensures fast answers, even outside working hours.

**Measured impact**: African pages with an automatic FAQ respond 15x faster and convert 3x better.

**Concrete case - Abidjan cosmetics shop**:
- Before FAQ: 180 questions/day, 4h average response time, 8% conversion
- After FAQ: Same volume, 6-minute response time, 26% conversion
- Savings: 3h/day freed up for strategy

## Step 1: Identify Your 15-20 Recurring Questions

### Analyze your comments from the last 30 days

Categorize by theme:

**Commercial questions (60% of volume)**:
- Price and availability: "How much is it?", "Do you have stock?"
- Delivery and timelines: "Where do you deliver?", "How long does it take?"
- Payment methods: "Do you accept Orange Money?", "How can we pay?"
- Location: "Where are you exactly?", "Your address?"

**Operational questions (25%)**:
- Hours: "What time do you open?", "Open on Sunday?"
- Ordering process: "How do I order?", "How do I do it?"
- Guarantees and returns: "If I don't like it?", "Do you refund?"

**Customer service questions (15%)**:
- Order tracking: "Where is my order?", "Tracking number?"
- Product problems: "It doesn't work", "It's defective"

**Concrete example - Douala restaurant**:

Top 10 questions (represent 85% of volume):
1. "Do you deliver?" → 32% of questions
2. "How much is [dish X]?" → 18%
3. "Are you open?" → 12%
4. "How to order?" → 9%
5. "Menu of the day?" → 7%
6. "Delivery time?" → 5%
7. "Do you accept Mobile Money?" → 4%
8. "Your address?" → 3%
9. "Book a table?" → 2%
10. "Parking available?" → 1%

## Step 2: Write Short and Actionable Replies

### Golden writing rules

**Length**: 2-4 sentences maximum
**Structure**: Direct answer + extra info + action/link
**Tone**: Consistent with your brand but always warm

### Examples of good FAQ responses

**Q: "How much is it?"**
❌ Bad: "Hello, thank you for your interest. The price depends on the model and options. Can you specify which one interests you?"
✅ Good: "Hello! The price is 25,000 CFA, delivery included in Abidjan. To order now: WhatsApp [link] 😊"

**Q: "Do you deliver to Yopougon?"**
❌ Bad: "Yes we deliver in Abidjan and surrounding areas subject to availability."
✅ Good: "Yes, delivery to Yopougon in 24-48h for 2,000 CFA. Order here: [link]"

**Q: "Do you accept Orange Money?"**
❌ Bad: "We accept several payment methods. Contact us for more info."
✅ Good: "Yes! Orange Money, MTN and Wave accepted. Official number: +225 XX XX XX XX (also in bio)"

**Q: "Where are you located?"**
❌ Bad: "We are located in Abidjan."
✅ Good: "Cocody Angré 8e Tranche, opposite Total station. Exact location: [Google Maps link]"

### Universal reply template

```
[Direct answer to the question]
[Useful additional info]
[Call-to-action with link/contact]
```

## Step 3: Define Precise Triggers

### Keywords by category

**Price/Rate**:
- Triggers: "combien", "prix", "coût", "coute", "tarif", "c combien", "c cb"
- Common misspellings: "conbien", "pri", "combient"

**Delivery**:
- Triggers: "livraison", "livrer", "livrez", "envoi", "envoyer", "expédition"
- Related questions: "vous livrez [lieu]", "délai", "frais de livraison"

**Availability**:
- Triggers: "disponible", "dispo", "stock", "en stock", "vous avez"

**Payment**:
- Triggers: "payer", "paiement", "orange money", "mtn", "wave", "mobile money", "espèces"

**Location**:
- Triggers: "où", "adresse", "localisation", "vous êtes où", "situé"

**Hours**:
- Triggers: "ouvert", "heure", "horaire", "ferme", "à quelle heure"

### Handle multiple intents

If a comment contains multiple questions: "C'est combien et vous livrez où ?"

**Option 1**: Combined reply
"Price: 25,000 CFA. Delivery across Côte d'Ivoire (fees by city). Full details here: [link]"

**Option 2**: Prioritized reply (price first)
"Price: 25,000 CFA, delivery included in Abidjan. Other cities: contact WhatsApp [link]"

### Anti-spam limitation

- Maximum 1 auto reply per person every 10 minutes
- If the same person asks 3+ questions in a row → Human escalation
- If reply is unsatisfactory (user replies "but...") → Escalation

## Step 4: Manage Sensitive Cases with Smart Escalation

### Cases to NEVER automate

**Serious complaints**:
- Triggers: "scam", "fraud", "complaint", "lawyer", "police", "court"
- Action: Immediate alert + human reply < 30 min

**Product issues**:
- "Doesn't work", "defective", "broken", "damaged"
- Temporary reply: "Sorry for the inconvenience. A manager will contact you within 15 min for a quick solution."

**Custom requests**:
- "Special order", "custom-made", "large quantity"
- Reply: "Great! For this specific request, contact [manager name] directly: [WhatsApp]"

### Universal exit line

Add to every automatic FAQ:

"If your question is different, write to us in DM or WhatsApp [link] for a personalized answer 😊"

## Step 5: Measure and Optimize Continuously

### KPIs to track weekly

1. **FAQ coverage rate**: % of questions resolved by FAQ
   - Target: > 65%

2. **Average response time**
   - Before FAQ vs After FAQ
   - Target: < 2 minutes

3. **Click-through rate on links**
   - How many click WhatsApp/Site after reply
   - Target: > 40%

4. **Uncovered questions**
   - New questions appearing frequently
   - Action: Add to FAQ if > 10 occurrences/week

5. **Escalation rate**
   - % of conversations requiring human intervention
   - Target: < 25%

6. **Satisfaction rate**
   - Measured via "thanks", positive emojis, purchases
   - Target: > 80%

### Optimization routine

**Weekly (15 min)**:
- Identify 3-5 new recurring questions
- Write answers and add triggers
- Check link click rate (replace if < 20%)

**Monthly (1h)**:
- Analyze false positives (bad auto replies)
- Adjust overly broad triggers
- A/B test 2 versions of important replies
- Update prices/info if changes

## Fatal Errors to Avoid

### Error 1: Replies that are too long

❌ 10-line wall of text → Nobody reads
✅ Maximum 4 short lines

### Error 2: Dead or complicated links

❌ "Visit our site www.longueurl.com/fr/boutique/category/produits"
✅ "Order here: [short WhatsApp link]"

Check all links monthly!

### Error 3: Robotic replies

❌ "Your request has been recorded. Please wait."
✅ "Great! We'll reply within 5 min max 😊"

### Error 4: Ignoring context

If someone says "It's too expensive!" do NOT automatically reply with the price FAQ.
→ Human escalation for negotiation.

### Error 5: FAQ on complaints

❌ Automating "We're sorry..." on a serious complaint
✅ Always escalate to human on very negative sentiment

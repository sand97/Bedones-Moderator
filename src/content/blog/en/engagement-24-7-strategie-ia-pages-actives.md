## Why 24/7 Engagement Has Become Critical in Africa

In Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon, audiences are active all day. According to a 2025 study, 68% of interactions on African pages happen between 18h and 23h, and 45% happen on weekends.

Customers comment in the evening after work, on weekends, and during sponsored campaign peaks. Without a quick response, you lose sales and trust.

**Key statistic**: A response delay of more than 2 hours reduces conversion rate by 67%.

**Concrete case - E-commerce Dakar**:
- Before 24/7 AI: Available 9h-18h → 72% of questions unanswered
- After 24/7 AI: 97% response rate → +240% night conversions
- Monthly gain: 850,000 CFA additional revenue

## The Real Cost of Unavailability

### Loss of direct sales

**Typical scenario**:
- 20h: Customer asks about product availability
- 9h (next day): You respond
- Result: Customer already bought elsewhere

**Estimated loss**: 35-50% of night and weekend purchase intent.

### Deterioration of brand perception

Slow response time = unprofessional brand.

**African study 2025**: 78% of African consumers consider a brand "not serious" if it replies after more than 3 hours.

### Opportunity for competitors

Your competitors with 24/7 AI capture your customers during your off hours.

## Identify Your Sensitive Hours

### Analyze your comment peaks

Use Facebook Insights to identify:
- **Peak hours**: Generally 19h-22h in francophone Africa
- **High-audience days**: Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- **High-engagement posts**: Sponsored posts, launches, promotions

**Example - Abidjan fashion shop**:
- Absolute peak: Friday 20h-23h (32% of weekly comments)
- Secondary peak: Sunday 18h-21h (18% of comments)
- Low hours: Tuesday-Thursday 10h-14h (8% of comments)

### Map purchase intent

Identify when "hot" questions arrive:
- Price/availability questions: Mostly evenings and weekends
- Customer service questions: More during the day
- Toxic comments: Peaks after 21h

## Structure Your Automated Replies by Priority Level

### Level 1: Simple questions - Immediate reply (seconds)

**Triggers**:
- "price", "how much", "cost"
- "available", "stock", "in stock"
- "delivery", "timeline", "send"
- "pay", "payment", "mobile money"

**Examples of automated replies**:

**Q: "How much is it?"**
R: "Hello! The price is 25,000 CFA. Delivery included in Abidjan. To order: WhatsApp [link] or reply 'ORDER'. Thanks! 😊"

**Q: "Do you deliver to Yopougon?"**
R: "Yes, we deliver to Yopougon in 24-48h. Delivery fee: 2,000 CFA. To order: [WhatsApp link]. Thank you!"

### Level 2: Sensitive requests - Human escalation (minutes-hours)

**Triggers**:
- "problem", "unsatisfied", "refund"
- "scam", "fraud", "theft"
- Negative tone detected by AI

**Temporary automated reply**:
"We have received your message. A manager will contact you within 30 minutes to resolve your situation. Thank you for your patience."

**Action**: Immediate push alert to the manager.

### Level 3: Hot prospects - Maximum priority (immediate)

**Triggers**:
- "buy", "order", "book"
- "take X", "I want"
- Multiple questions in a row (= strong interest)

**Automated reply**:
"Great! To finalize your order quickly, contact us on WhatsApp: [link]. You will get a reply in less than 5 minutes, even now 😊"

**Action**: High-priority alert + WhatsApp transfer.

## Keep a Human in the Loop (Hybrid Model)

### Daily review of hidden comments

**Morning routine (15 min)**:
- Review automatically hidden comments
- Validate or restore if false positive
- Adjust rules if needed

### Adjust rules each week

**Friday routine (30 min)**:
- Analyze false positive/negative rate
- Enrich the automated reply base
- Add new detected FAQs

### Manual intervention for disputes

**Auto-escalation criteria**:
- Amount at stake > 50,000 CFA
- Mention of "lawyer", "complaint", "police"
- VIP customer identified
- Very negative sentiment

**Required human response time**: < 30 minutes.

## Example of a Successful 24/7 Configuration

**Profile - Douala restaurant, 25K followers**:

**Time slots**:
- **6h-9h**: AI only (low volume) → breakfast FAQ, reservations
- **9h-18h**: Hybrid AI + human → AI handles 80%, human 20%
- **18h-23h**: Reinforced hybrid → AI handles 70%, human 30% (order peak)
- **23h-6h**: AI only → basic replies, escalation for the morning

**Results after 2 months**:
- Response rate: 47% → 96%
- Average response time: 3h15 → 8 minutes
- Comment conversions: 12% → 34%
- Revenue generated via comments: +1.2 million CFA/month
- Cost: 45,000 CFA/month (AI) vs 180,000 before (2 CMs)

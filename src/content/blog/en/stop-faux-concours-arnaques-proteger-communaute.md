## Why Fake Giveaways Proliferate in Africa

With 299 million social media users in Africa, scammers have a massive playground. They leverage your audience to promise gifts in exchange for money or personal information.

**Scale of the problem**: According to a 2025 study, 42% of high-audience African pages were targeted by at least one fake giveaway scam attempt.

**Impact**: This destroys your community's trust and can make you lose customers.

**Real case - Abidjan influencer**: A page with 85K followers lost 12,000 followers in 2 weeks after a fake giveaway in comments scammed 47 people for a total of 2.3 million CFA.

## The 5 Most Common Scam Types

### 1. Fake "guaranteed winner" giveaways

"Congratulations! You won 500,000 CFA. To validate, pay 15,000 CFA processing fees to this number..."

**Target**: Known brand pages, lifestyle influencers

### 2. WhatsApp Business phishing

"To order, contact our WhatsApp Business: +XXX..." (fraudulent number impersonating you)

**Impact**: Your customers pay scammers thinking they are buying from you.

### 3. Fake partnerships

"In partnership with [your brand], win an iPhone by clicking here..."

**Consequence**: Your brand is associated with a scam.

### 4. Mobile Money scams

"Send 5,000 CFA on Orange Money to validate your participation in the draw..."

**Volume**: Represents 35% of scams on African pages.

### 5. Page identity theft

Creation of a fake page almost identical to yours to scam your community.

## Warning Signs to Recognize Immediately

### Critical indicators

✗ **Unknown external links**: bit.ly, tinyurl to suspicious sites
✗ **Payment request**: "Pay X CFA to validate", "Processing fees", "Refundable deposit"
✗ **Excessive urgency**: "Only 10 spots!", "Offer expires in 1h!"
✗ **Suspicious spelling**: Many errors, weird syntax
✗ **Unofficial numbers**: WhatsApp or Mobile Money different from yours
✗ **Recent accounts**: Profile created a few days ago, little activity
✗ **Unrealistic promises**: "Win 1 million CFA guaranteed!"

### Example of a typical fake comment

"🎉🎉 CONGRATS!! You won 500.000fcfa + 1 iPhone 15!! To validate your prize send 10.000fcfa activation fees Orange Money: 07 XX XX XX XX. URGENT only 5 spots!!!"

**Warning signs**: Spelling, excessive punctuation, unrealistic amount, request for money, urgency.

## Prevention Plan in 7 Steps

### 1. Clarify your official channels visibly

**In your bio**:
- ✅ Official WhatsApp: +XXX XX XX XX XX
- ✅ Orange Money: +XXX XX XX XX XX
- ✅ Website: www.yourbrand.com
- ⚠️ Any other number is a scam

**In a highlight story "Important info"**:
Create a permanent story listing your real contacts and warning against fakes.

### 2. Pin an official comment on every post

**Template**:
"⚠️ Beware of scams! We NEVER ask for payment in comments. Our only official contacts: WhatsApp [link] and website [link]. Report any suspicious comment."

### 3. Block sensitive words if you don't run giveaways

List of words to filter automatically:
- "won", "winner", "congratulations", "draw"
- "validate your prize", "processing fees", "deposit"
- "send", "orange money", "mtn money" (outside your official posts)
- Misspellings: "congrats", "winer", etc.

### 4. Enable comment notifications

To quickly detect scam attempts on your sponsored posts.

### 5. Educate your community

Post regular reminders:
- "We NEVER charge for a gift"
- "Our giveaways are announced officially on our page"
- "If in doubt, contact us in DM"

### 6. Verify your verification badge (if eligible)

The blue badge reduces impersonation attempts by 70%.

### 7. Monitor fake pages using your name

Regularly search your brand name on Facebook/Instagram to detect copies.

## Why Compliance Has Become Critical in 2026

In Côte d'Ivoire, with 8.4 million Facebook users (+22.6% in one year), influencers manage massive audiences. In Cameroon, 6.17 million Facebook users interact daily. This growth attracts regulators' attention.

Laws evolve quickly in Africa. A checklist helps you stay organized and prove your diligence in case of audit. In Côte d'Ivoire particularly, influencers exceeding 25,000 followers can be held responsible for comments on their pages.

## The African Regulatory Context

In several African countries, responsibility for published content and comments extends to page administrators. Sanctions include:

- Fines that can reach several million CFA francs
- Page suspension or closure
- Legal prosecution for illicit content

**Concrete Case**: In 2025, an Ivorian influencer saw her page suspended for 3 weeks following unmoderated hate comments under a sponsored publication. She lost 2 advertising contracts estimated at 1.5 million CFA.

## Complete Checklist in 10 Points

### 1. Visible Comment Charter

Display a clear charter on your page, in highlighted story and under sponsored posts. It must specify:
- Prohibited comment types
- Consequences (hiding, deletion, blocking)
- Your official contact channels

### 2. Documented Moderation Rules

Create an internal document listing:
- Words and expressions to block automatically
- Maximum reaction time (recommended: 30 minutes)
- Who has access to moderation tools

### 3. Automatic Filtering of Insults and Links

Enable native Facebook/Instagram filters and supplement with a dedicated solution to:
- Detect suspicious links
- Block profanity in French, nouchi, pidgin
- Hide at-risk content

### 4. Defined Reaction Time

Commit to a maximum response time, especially for:
- Sponsored publications (15-30 minutes)
- High virality posts (less than 1 hour)
- Sensitive content (immediate)

### 5. Preserved Moderation Action History

Keep for at least 12 months:
- Date and time of each action
- Moderated comment content
- Reason for moderation
- Name of person who made decision

### 6. Monthly Compliance Reports

Generate each month a report including:
- Number of comments processed
- Rate of hidden/deleted comments
- Types of detected violations
- Corrective actions taken

### 7. Limited and Secure Admin Access

- Maximum 2-3 people with full access
- Mandatory two-factor authentication
- Passwords changed every 90 days
- Quarterly access review

### 8. Legal Escalation Procedure

Define a clear process for:
- Serious threats (immediate contact with authorities)
- Defamatory content (legal consultation)
- Commercial disputes (mediation)

### 9. Team or Community Manager Training

Mandatory training on:
- Local legislation in force
- Spam and scam patterns
- Use of moderation tools
- Crisis management

### 10. Quarterly Rules Audit

Every 3 months:
- Analyze false positives and negatives
- Adjust your blocked word lists
- Verify that timeframes are met
- Update according to new laws

## Essential Documents to Preserve

### Operational Documents
- Time-stamped screenshots of actions
- Detailed logs of deleted comments
- Exported monthly reports (secured PDF)

### Legal Documents
- Copy of your comment charter
- Proof of charter publication
- History of your rule updates
- Correspondence with authorities (if applicable)

## Compliance Statistics to Track

Measure monthly:
- **Reactivity Rate**: % of comments processed in less than 30 min
- **Coverage Rate**: % of moderated publications
- **Risk Score**: number of sensitive content escaped
- **Average Resolution Time**: time between detection and action

**African Benchmark**: The best-managed pages maintain a reactivity rate above 85% and an average resolution time under 20 minutes.

## The African Social Media Purchase Journey Is Unique

In Côte d'Ivoire (8.4M Facebook users) and Cameroon (6.17M), **60-85% of e-commerce sales start on Facebook/Instagram**. Unlike Europe/US where the journey goes through a website, in Africa the customer follows this path:

1. **Discovery**: Sees product via organic post or ad
2. **Validation**: Reads comments to confirm trust
3. **Question**: Comments to ask price/delivery
4. **Negotiation**: Moves to private WhatsApp
5. **Payment**: Mobile Money (Orange/MTN)
6. **Delivery**: Coordinated via WhatsApp

**The sale happens in public interaction**: a clean, reassuring, responsive comment thread multiplies conversions by 3-5x.

**Real case - Abidjan fashion shop**:
- Before optimization: 180 ad views → 8 comments → 1 sale (0.6% conversion)
- After optimization (post + ad + moderation): 180 views → 34 comments → 12 sales (6.7% conversion)
- **Improvement: +1,100% sales**

## Step 1: Post to Create Demand (Organic)

### Prioritize social proof

**African reality**: 83% of buyers read customer reviews BEFORE buying.

**Format that converts**:
- Product photo + satisfied customer photo (before/after)
- Short written testimonial: "Delivered in 24h to Yopougon. Great quality! Thanks 🙏"
- Tag customer (with permission) for authenticity

**High-performing post example - Douala cosmetics**:
```
"✨ Result after 7 days! ✨

Thanks @ClientX for the trust 🙏
Delivery Bonabéri: 1,500 CFA
Order: WhatsApp 📱 +237 XX XX XX XX

#beauté #douala #cameroun"
```
**Performance**: 840 views, 67 comments, 18 sales.

### Short mobile-friendly formats

**Statistic**: 92% of Africans access social media only via mobile.

**Winning formats**:
- **Reels 15-30 sec**: Product in action + trending music
- **Stories**: Behind-the-scenes, instant testimonials, flash promos
- **Carousel**: Price + Options + Delivery (max 3 slides)

**Avoid**: Videos > 1 min (expensive mobile data).

### Local language when relevant

**Winning examples**:
- Abidjan: Mix French + Nouchi ("C'est trop gnaaa !")
- Dakar: French + Francophone Wolof ("Nga def ?")
- Douala: French + Pidgin ("E don fit well")

**Impact**: +28% engagement vs strict French (2025 study).

### African audience hours

| Slot | Audience | Content type |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 6h-8h | 35% | Motivation, news, promos |
| 12h-14h | 45% | Short content, stories |
| 18h-23h | 65% | Products, testimonials, sales |

**Optimal post**: 19h-20h (engagement peak).

## Step 2: Sponsor to Accelerate (Paid Ads)

### Systematic A/B testing

**Startup protocol**:
- Create 3 different visuals (same product)
- Test budget: 15,000 CFA per visual (3 days)
- Identify winner (CTR + conversions)
- Scale budget on winner

**Abidjan e-commerce case**:
- Visual A (white background): CTR 1.2%, 3 sales
- Visual B (lifestyle): CTR 2.8%, 9 sales
- Visual C (testimonial): CTR 4.1%, 14 sales ← Winner!
- Scale on C: Budget x5 → 70 sales

### Hyper-local targeting is essential

**Common mistake**: Targeting all "Côte d'Ivoire" when delivery is only Abidjan.

**Good targeting**:
- Specific cities: Abidjan, Yopougon, Cocody, Plateau
- Radius: 10-25 km max (realistic delivery)
- Interests: Fashion, beauty, high-tech (depending on product)

**Impact**: CPA reduced by 50-70% vs broad targeting.

### Dynamic budget on winners

**Smart approach**:
- Week 1: 50,000 CFA split across 3 ads
- Identify ad generating 70% of sales
- Week 2: 70% budget on winner, 30% to test new ideas

**Avoid**: Splitting budget evenly across everything (dilutes performance).

## Step 3: Moderate to Convert (CRITICAL)

### Moderation impact on conversions

**Shocking statistic**: Poorly moderated thread reduces conversions by 40-70%.

**Why**:
- Visible scams → Total trust loss
- Unanswered questions → Prospect goes to competitor
- Visible spam → Page looks "cheap"

**Catastrophic case - Douala smartphone launch**:
- Ad budget: 850,000 CFA, 1,240 comments in 48h
- Without moderation: 47 fake WhatsApp contacts posted, 180+ people contacted, 23 successful scams
- Result: Reputation destroyed, campaign failed, loss 9.1M CFA

**With real-time moderation**: 98% scams blocked < 45 sec.

### 3 essential moderation actions

**1. Block suspicious links (< 60 sec)**:
- Unverified external links
- Shortened URLs (bit.ly)
- Fake WhatsApp numbers

**2. Reply fast to purchase questions (< 5 min)**:
- Exact price
- Delivery (cities, timelines, fees)
- Payment (mobile money accepted)
- Stock availability

**Statistic**: Response < 5 min = 68% conversion. Response > 30 min = 12% conversion.

**3. Pin an official comment**:

"🔥 OFFICIAL INFO

Price: 25,000 CFA
📦 Delivery Abidjan: 1,500 CFA
💳 Payment: Orange Money, MTN, cash
📱 Order: WhatsApp +225 XX XX XX XX (also in bio)

⚠️ Beware of fake contacts! Only this number is official."

**Impact**: Reduces repetitive questions by 45%, blocks 80% of scams.

## Step 4: Make Payment Easy

### Mobile Money is mandatory

**Reality**: 78% of Ivorians use mobile money, only 16% have a bank card.

**Minimum setup**:
- Orange Money (50-60% market share)
- MTN Mobile Money (25-35%)

**Via aggregator**: CinetPay, Fedapay (2-4 day integration).

### Local currency is non-negotiable

**Mistake**: Display "$40/month"
**Impact**: -50% conversions (confusion + "expensive" perception)

**Correct**: "25,000 CFA/month"
**Perception**: Affordable, local, clear.

### Fast confirmation is critical

**After mobile money payment**:
- Automatic SMS: "Payment received! Delivery in 24-48h. Tracking: [link]"
- WhatsApp message with order details
- Delay: < 2 minutes

**Impact**: Reduces customer anxiety, limits disputes by 85%.

## Step 5: Retain After the Sale

### Ask for reviews in public comments

**2-3 days after delivery**:
SMS: "Hi [FirstName]! Happy with your purchase? Leave a review on our Facebook page to help other customers 🙏 [Direct post link]"

**Incentive**: "Post photo + review → 2,000 CFA discount on next order"

**Response rate**: 15-25% (excellent).

### Reuse reviews for future posts

**Monthly "Wall of satisfaction" post**:
- 6-9 real customer testimonials
- Photos of received products
- Names + neighborhoods (with permission)

**Performance**: These posts generate 2-3x more conversions than classic product posts.

### Handle negative reviews calmly

**Protocol**:
1. Reply publicly < 2h: "Sorry for this experience. Contact us privately for a quick solution 🙏"
2. Resolve in private (refund, replacement)
3. Ask for comment update if resolved

**Statistic**: 70% of negative customers become promoters if the issue is resolved quickly.

## The 7 Errors That Lose Sales

### 1. Let competitors capture your conversation

**Error**: Competitor comments "We are cheaper. Visit our page."
→ Visible 2h before hiding

**Loss**: 15-30 potential prospects diverted.

### 2. Ignore delivery questions

**Statistic**: 47% of comments are about delivery/payment.

**Impact if ignored**: Prospect thinks "Not serious" and leaves.

### 3. No official channel displayed

**Result**: Confusion, repetitive questions, easier scams.

### 4. Respond more than 30 minutes later

**African reality**: Prospect contacts 2-3 sellers simultaneously.
**First to reply wins**: 65% of sales.

### 5. Price not clearly displayed

**Error**: "Price in inbox"
**Impact**: -35% conversions (unnecessary friction).

**Correct**: Display price in the post.

### 6. No follow-up after payment

**Consequence**: Anxious customer, disputes, bad reviews.

### 7. Ignore constructive criticism

**Example**: "Delivery too slow"
→ If 10+ customers say it, it's a real issue to solve.

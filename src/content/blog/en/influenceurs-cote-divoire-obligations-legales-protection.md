## Why Côte d'Ivoire Has Become a High-Risk Legal Market

With 8.4 million Facebook users (+22.6% in one year), Côte d'Ivoire is seeing an explosion of influencers. But the legal framework is evolving quickly, and influencers/page administrators can be held liable for comments published on their pages.

**2025-2026 context**: Tougher laws on online content, especially after several high-profile cases of hate speech and misinformation.

**Recent case - Abidjan tech influencer (35K followers)**:
- Unmoderated hateful comment under sponsored video
- Report to ARTCI (regulator)
- Summons, 2.5 million CFA fine + page suspended 30 days
- Loss: 3 advertising contracts = 4.2 million CFA

Moderation is no longer an option, it is a **de facto legal obligation**.

## The Ivorian Legal Framework in 2026

### Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Law

**Main text**: Law No. 2013-451 of June 19, 2013 and recent updates.

**What it says**:
- Hosts (including page owners) have a moderation obligation
- Removal deadline for illegal content: 24-48h after reporting
- Criminal liability possible if negligence is proven

### Influence threshold and enhanced obligations

**From ~25,000 followers**:
- Enhanced compliance obligation
- Declaration to ARTCI recommended
- Obligation of means (not just results) for moderation

**Between 5,000 and 25,000**:
- Standard obligations
- Reasonable diligence expected

**Below 5,000**:
- Lower risk but not zero
- Good faith required

### Types of content particularly targeted

1. **Hate speech**: Ethnic, religious, regional
2. **Misinformation**: Public health, elections, security
3. **Violent content**: Calls for violence, threats
4. **Harm to minors**: Enhanced protection
5. **Defamation**: Especially against institutions/personalities

### Sanctions in 2026

**Administrative sanctions (ARTCI)**:
- Warning
- Fine: 500,000 to 5,000,000 CFA
- Temporary page suspension
- Permanent closure (serious cases)

**Criminal sanctions (Justice)**:
- Fines up to 10 million CFA
- Prison sentences: 1 month to 5 years depending on severity
- Ban on practicing

**Commercial sanctions**:
- Loss of partnerships (brands avoid risks)
- Reputation damage
- Difficulty monetizing

## Concrete Risks for Your Influencer Activity

### Risk 1: Sudden loss of income

**Typical scenario**:
- You generate 800,000 CFA/month in partnerships
- Moderation incident → Page suspended 2 months
- Loss: 1.6 million CFA + brands that don't return

**Real case - Abidjan lifestyle influencer (45K)**:
- Unmoderated homophobic comments under beauty post
- Suspension 45 days
- 5 brands terminated contracts
- Total loss: ~6 million CFA

### Risk 2: Long-term damage to your image

A legal bad buzz lingers:
- Negative press articles
- Loss of credibility
- Difficulty signing new contracts
- Community engagement drop

### Risk 3: Personal financial sanctions

Fines are your responsibility, not your partner brands'.

**Impact**: A 3 million CFA fine = 4-6 months of income for an average influencer.

### Risk 4: Stress and lost time

Summons, procedures, lawyers → Time not spent on your activity.

## 8 Priority and Actionable Protection Measures

### 1. Publish a visible and enforceable comment charter

**Where to display it**:
- Highlight story "Rules"
- Pinned comment on sensitive posts
- "About" section

**Minimum content**:
- Types of prohibited comments (precise list)
- Consequences (hide, delete, block)
- Announced moderation time (ex: "within 2h")
- Contact for disputes

**Optimized CI example**:
"Welcome! Family rules:
✅ Mutual respect required
❌ Hate speech, insults, misinformation
❌ Unverified links, spam
Moderation within 2h. Repeat offenders = blocked. Thank you! 🙏"

### 2. Moderate continuously with proof of diligence

**Reasonable diligence** = Prove that you did your best.

**Daily checklist**:
- Morning (30 min): Review overnight comments
- Midday (15 min): Quick check
- Evening (30 min): Final review + report

**Maximum acceptable delay**: 2h for sensitive content, 24h for the rest.

### 3. Document ALL your moderation actions

**What to keep (12 months minimum)**:
- Screenshot of the comment
- Date/time of detection
- Action taken (hidden/deleted/blocked)
- Reason (which rule was violated)
- Name of the person who made the decision

**Recommended format**: Google Sheets or Notion with columns:
| Date | Time | Author | Comment | Action | Reason | Responsible |

**Use case**: In case of audit or dispute, this document proves your good faith.

### 4. Train your team or CM on Ivorian specifics

**Mandatory training** (2h minimum):
- CI-specific legal framework
- Particularly sensitive content in CI
- Moderation process to follow
- Escalation for legal cases

**Validation test**: Quiz to verify understanding.

### 5. Set up an automatic alert system

**Keywords to monitor in Côte d'Ivoire**:
- Sensitive ethnic terms
- Polarizing political references
- Recurring health/security rumors

**Action**: Immediate push alert + automatic quarantine.

### 6. Take out professional liability insurance

**Why**: Covers legal defense costs + possible fines.

**Cost**: 150,000 - 400,000 CFA/year depending on revenue.

**Return**: Peace of mind + coverage up to 50 million CFA.

### 7. Have an identified legal counsel

**No need for a permanent lawyer**, but:
- Identify a lawyer specialized in CI digital law
- First consultation for compliance audit
- Emergency contact if incident

**Cost**: Consultation 50,000 - 100,000 CFA, essential investment.

### 8. Generate monthly compliance reports

**Report content**:
- Total number of comments received
- Number of moderated comments
- Types of violations detected
- Average handling time
- Improvement actions

**Usefulness**: Proof of professionalism + basis for continuous improvement.

## The Strategic Importance of Moderation Reports

In case of dispute or ARTCI audit, a complete report is your best defense.

**Winning case - Abidjan food influencer (28K)**:
- Defamatory comment against a competing restaurant
- Restaurant files a complaint
- Influencer presents:
  - Charter published for 6 months
  - Moderation log: comment hidden in 47 min
  - Monthly report showing consistent diligence
- Result: Complaint dismissed, good faith recognized

**Without these proofs**: Risk of conviction even with good intentions.

## Urgent Checklist if You Are Summoned

### Day 0: Summons received

1. **Don't panic** (common, not always serious)
2. **Contact a lawyer** immediately
3. **Gather all your documents**:
   - Comment charter
   - Moderation logs
   - Monthly reports
   - Screenshots
4. **Do NOT delete anything** (evidence destruction = aggravating)

### Before the appointment

5. **Prepare a factual timeline** of events
6. **Identify good-faith actions** taken
7. **List improvements** since the incident (if applicable)

### During the appointment

8. **Stay courteous** and cooperative
9. **Show your proof** of diligence
10. **Let your lawyer speak** (you only confirm)

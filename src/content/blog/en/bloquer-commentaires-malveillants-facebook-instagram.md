## Why Malicious Comments Are a Critical Risk in Africa

In Côte d'Ivoire (8.4M Facebook users) and Cameroon (6.17M), your Facebook/Instagram comments are your brand's public showcase. **A toxic message visible > 2h can drive away 40-70 potential customers, destroy your reputation, and engage your legal liability** (fines 500K-5M CFA).

**Problem Scale**: 73% of African pages 15K+ receive 3-12 malicious comments/week.

**Catastrophic Case - Restaurant Abidjan (8K)**:
- Ethnic hate comment under promotion post
- Remained visible 6h before deletion (undetected)
- Result: 340+ reports, page suspended 15 days
- Loss: 950,000 CFA (15 days closure) + 2 lost partnerships
- Reputation: 3 months to restore trust

**With Proactive Moderation**: Comment hidden in < 2 min, 0 reports, page protected.

## The 5 Categories of African Malicious Comments

### 1. Insults and Harassment (38% of cases)

**Forms**: Personal attacks, threats, humiliating remarks destroying conversation.

**African Specificities**:
- Ethnic insults (very sensitive)
- Credible physical threats
- Gender-based harassment (female entrepreneurs targeted)

**CI Example**: "The [ethnic X] are all thieves" → Immediate deletion + reporting.

**Impact**: Destroys community environment, customers flee.

### 2. Hate Speech (15% of cases - VERY SERIOUS)

**Targets**: Ethnicity, religion, region, orientation, gender.

**African Context**: Ethnic/regional tensions make certain words ultra-sensitive.

**Legal Consequence CI/Cameroon**:
- Not removed within 24-48h → Liability engaged
- Sanction: 500K-5M CFA fine + page suspension
- Repeat offense: Possible criminal prosecution

**Real Case - Cultural Page Abidjan (22K)**:
- Offensive ethnic comment under traditions post
- Visible 6h → 340+ reports → Page suspended 15 days

### 3. Scams and Phishing (28% of cases)

**Types**:
- Fake contests ("Win iPhone! Pay 2,000 CFA delivery fee")
- Phishing links to clone sites
- Requests for sensitive info (Orange Money PIN code)
- Fake WhatsApp numbers impersonating you

**Danger**: Scammed customers blame you even if it's not your fault.

**Statistic**: 58% of African campaigns suffer hijacking attempts.

### 4. Commercial Hijacking (12% of cases)

**Techniques**:
- Competitor comments "Cheaper at our place. Visit our page."
- Fake seller offers "Special price" with their contact

**Impact**: Diverts prospects, sows doubt, direct sales loss.

**Douala Shop Example**:
- Competitor posts 8 hijacking comments in 2h
- 23 prospects diverted before blocking
- Estimated loss: 18-25 sales = 450K-625K CFA

### 5. Misinformation (7% of cases)

**Forms**:
- Product rumors ("I heard it's fake/dangerous")
- Fake negative reviews (account created yesterday)
- Fake news targeting your brand

**Impact**: Weakens trust, requires crisis management.

**Yaoundé Restaurant Example**:
- Fake review: "I got food poisoning here"
- Account created 2 days ago, 0 activity
- Visible 4h → 180+ views → Doubt sown

**Correct Response**:
1. Hide comment (obvious fake)
2. Reply publicly: "We have no record of this visit. Suspicious account reported."
3. Report account to Meta

## Where and When Attacks Appear Most

### High-Risk Publications

1. **High Visibility Sponsored** (60% of attacks)
   - Budget 300K-800K CFA
   - 500-2000 comments in 24-48h
   - Attract scams + competitors

2. **Product Launches/Promotions** (25%)
   - Key business moments
   - Jealous competitors

3. **Sensitive Topics** (15%)
   - Politics, ethnicity, religion, society
   - Comments inflame quickly

**High-Risk Hours**:
- 18h-23h (65% active audience)
- Weekends (volume x2)

## 6-Step Method to Block Effectively

### Step 1: Define Clear Charter (Publicly Displayed)

**Africa-Adapted Charter Example**:

"Respect Rules:
✅ Open debate, constructive criticism
❌ Ethnic, regional, religious insults
❌ Threats, harassment
❌ Scams, fake contacts
❌ Unverified external links
❌ Unauthorized promotion

Active moderation to protect everyone. Thank you! 🙏"

**Publication**:
- Pinned post on page
- Reminder under sensitive publications

### Step 2: Configure Native Facebook/Instagram Filters

**Enable**:
- Profanity filter (moderate → strong)
- Banned words list (ethnic insults, threats)
- Automatic hiding of sensitive terms
- Recent account blocking (< 7 days) with suspect words

**Limitation**: Native filters detect only 30-45% in Africa (ignore nouchi/pidgin).

### Step 3: Create Advanced Detection Patterns (AI)

**Added Rules**:
- Shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl) → Auto hiding
- Text repetitions > 3 times → Bot, blocking
- Non-official phone number → Quarantine
- Scam words ("win", "contest", "free" + CFA amount) → High risk score

**Scoring**:
- 8-10/10 → Immediate blocking
- 5-7/10 → Quarantine + human review < 2h
- < 5/10 → Publication

### Step 4: Classify by Risk Level

| Level | Criteria | Action | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| **SERIOUS** | Hate speech, threats, scams | Immediate deletion + author blocking | < 30 sec |
| **MEDIUM** | Insults, hijacking, misinformation | Hiding + human review | < 2h |
| **LOW** | Negative but legitimate criticism | Publication + response | None |

**Error to Avoid**: Over-moderating legitimate criticism (generates "censorship" bad buzz).

### Step 5: Escalate Ambiguous Cases (Local Human Review)

**Cases Requiring Human**:
- Subtle cultural context (nouchi/pidgin double meaning)
- Virulent but non-hateful criticism
- Legitimate negative review vs fake

**Protocol**:
1. AI flags ambiguous comment (score 5-7/10)
2. Temporary hiding (not publicly visible)
3. Native local moderator analyzes
4. Decision < 2h: Publish, Hide permanently, or Block

**Native Moderator Importance**: Understands cultural nuances (essential in Africa).

### Step 6: Preserve Traces (Legal Compliance)

**Mandatory Logs**:
- Comment date/time
- Exact content (screenshot)
- Action taken (hidden/deleted/blocked)
- Decision reason
- Moderator who acted

**Storage**: 12 months minimum (proof of diligence if dispute/audit).

**Suggested Format**:
```
[2026-01-15 14:23] - @UserX - "The [ethnicity] are all..." - DELETED - Reason: Ethnic hate speech - Moderator: AwaT
```

**Usefulness**: Proof of diligence during ARTCI/ANTIC audits, avoids fines.

## Hide vs Delete vs Block: Decision Guide

| Action | When to Use | Visible to Author? | Reversible? |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Hide** | Toxic remarks without debate, moderate spam | Yes (only they see) | Yes |
| **Delete** | Hate speech, scams, fraudulent links | No | No |
| **Block** | Repeat offenders (3+ violations), bots, professional scams | No | Yes (manual) |

**Hide Use Case**:
- Mild insult 1st time → Hide + private warning
- Competitor commercial spam → Hide + report to Meta

**Delete Use Case**:
- Ethnic/religious hate speech → Delete immediately
- Fake WhatsApp scam number → Delete + block author
- Phishing link → Delete + report to Meta

**Block Use Case**:
- 3+ detected spam comments → Permanent automatic blocking
- Obvious bot → Immediate blocking
- Professional scammer → Blocking + report to authorities

## Performance Indicators to Track

| Metric | Target | Alert if |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Serious comment detection time | < 2 min | > 10 min |
| Action time (hiding/deletion) | < 60 sec | > 5 min |
| Blocked malicious comments rate | > 95% | < 85% |
| False positives (legitimate hidden) | < 8% | > 15% |
| Reports received (Meta) | < 2/month | > 10/month |
| Positive engagement | > 75% | < 60% |

**Well-Moderated African Pages Benchmark**:
- Detection < 90 sec
- Blocking > 96%
- False positives 4-7%
- Reports < 1/month

## The 5 Fatal Errors to Avoid

### 1. Delete Without Explaining Rules

**Error**: Delete legitimate critical comment without reason → "Censorship" bad buzz

**Correct**: Publish charter, explain ambiguous decisions.

### 2. Leave External Links Uncontrolled

**Risk**: 85% external links on African pages = Spam/phishing.

**Action**: Block external links by default, whitelist known sites only.

### 3. Different Rules for Different People

**Error**: Let friend insult but block stranger for same thing.

**Impact**: Community loses trust, cries favoritism.

**Solution**: Rules applied fairly, even friends/family/VIP.

### 4. No Native Moderator

**Consequence**: Decisions out of cultural context → Over-censorship OR under-detection.

**Example**: Affectionate nouchi expression interpreted as insult by non-local moderator.

### 5. No Trace Preserved

**Risk**: If dispute or audit, no proof of diligence → Fine.

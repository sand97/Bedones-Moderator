## Why a Charter is Essential

With 8.4 million Facebook users in Côte d'Ivoire and 6.17 million in Cameroon, African brands and influencers manage increasingly large communities. Without visible rules, each comment deletion appears arbitrary and can trigger tensions.

A comment charter makes your actions legitimate, protects your image and reassures your community. It is also proof of diligence in case of legal dispute.

## The Impact of a Charter on Engagement

**African Case Study**: Maa Bio, Ivorian lifestyle influencer with over 120K followers, implemented a clear charter in 2025. Results after 3 months:

- 47% reduction in toxic comments
- 32% increase in positive engagement
- 60% reduced moderation time
- Zero disputes or deletion challenges

Without a charter, users can challenge your decisions and create controversies that harm your reputation.

## The 6 Essential Rules Every Charter Must Contain

### 1. Respect for People and Prohibition of Insults

Clearly specify:
- No personal attacks
- No threats or harassment
- No mockery targeting appearance, origin or beliefs

**Example**: "Insults, threats and personal attacks will be deleted without notice."

### 2. Prohibition of Hate Speech

Specify that content targeting:
- Ethnic origin
- Religion
- Gender or orientation
- Any other form of discrimination

will be deleted immediately.

### 3. No Fraudulent Links or Scams

Protect your community by prohibiting:
- Fake contests
- Money or personal information requests
- Suspicious or unverified shortened links
- Promises of quick gains

**Common Case in Africa**: "Easy money" scams and fake WhatsApp Business represent 35% of fraudulent comments on African pages.

### 4. No Unauthorized Advertising

Clarify that only your official partners can:
- Promote products or services
- Post commercial links
- Recruit or sell

### 5. No Repetitive Spam

Define spam as:
- Identical messages posted multiple times
- Repetitive meaningless emojis
- Copy-paste of promotional texts

### 6. Respect for Privacy

Prohibit:
- Publishing phone numbers
- Exposing others' personal information
- Screenshots of private conversations

## The Format That Works in Africa

### Short Version (6-10 lines)

Ideal for:
- Pinned comment
- Highlighted story
- Page description

**Côte d'Ivoire Example**:
"Welcome to our community! Here, we respect each other. No insults, no hate, no fake links. Unauthorized ads will be deleted. To order, contact us only on our official WhatsApp: [link]. Thank you!"

### Long Version (1 page)

For:
- "About" section
- Reference document
- Team training

## Adapt the Tone to Your Brand

### Young and Dynamic Brand
"Hey family! We love the positive vibe here. No drama, no fake links, just respect. If you want to contact us, it's via WhatsApp only. Thanks and see you soon!"

### Professional/Corporate Brand
"We encourage constructive exchanges. Disrespectful, defamatory comments or those containing unverified links will be moderated. For any commercial request, contact our official customer service."

### Local African Brand
"Akwaba/Welcome! Here it's family, we respect each other. We accept criticism but not insults. No fake numbers or suspicious links please. Our real contacts are in bio. Thank you for your understanding!"

## Where to Display Your Charter for Maximum Impact

### 1. Pinned Comment (Priority)

Under each sensitive publication:
- Product launches
- Important promotions
- Debate-generating topics
- Sponsored posts

### 2. Page Description

Condensed version in the "About" section of your Facebook/Instagram page.

### 3. Highlighted Story

Create a permanent "Community Rules" story with:
- Clear and readable text
- Design in your brand colors
- Link to full version

### 4. Automatic Welcome Message

Configure an automatic private message for new subscribers including:
- Personalized welcome
- Link to charter
- Official contact channels

### 5. In Your Sponsored Publications

Systematically add in first sentence:
"📌 Check our rules in pinned comment"

## How to Apply the Charter Without Creating Conflict

### Step 1: Educational Reminder First

Before deleting, respond:
"Hello! This type of comment goes against our charter. Please rephrase respectfully."

### Step 2: Hide to Avoid Escalation

For borderline content, hide rather than delete. The comment remains visible to its author but not to others.

### Step 3: Documented Deletion

For serious violations:
- Delete immediately
- Keep a screenshot
- Note reason in your log

### Step 4: Block as Last Resort

Reserved for repeat offenders or confirmed malicious accounts.

## Stay Consistent in Application

**Common Error**: Applying different rules based on:
- Person's notoriety
- Your personal relationships
- Your mood of the day

**Good Practice**: Treat all comments by same criteria. An influencer or partner is not above rules.

## Examples of Short Charters That Work

### Restaurant in Abidjan
"Welcome to Chez Fatou! We love your sincere but respectful reviews. No fake contests, no spam. To book: WhatsApp only at 07 XX XX XX XX. Bon appétit!"

### Fashion Shop Cameroon
"Fashion lovers, welcome! Here we share the passion for fashion with respect. Prices and availability in PM or WhatsApp. No external links please. Thank you!"

### Tech Influencer Senegal
"The tech familiya! Let's debate, learn, but stay correct. Zero tolerance for insults and scams. Tech questions welcome. Let's grow together!"

## Measure Your Charter's Effectiveness

Track these indicators:
- **Compliance Rate**: % of comments respecting the charter
- **Challenge Rate**: % of users challenging a deletion
- **Moderation Time**: before/after implementation
- **General Sentiment**: evolution of comment tone

**Benchmark**: A well-applied charter reduces moderation time by 40 to 60% on average.

## Conclusion

In Africa, where 299 million users are active on social networks in 2025, a clear charter transforms moderation into a fair, transparent and effective process. It protects your community, your brand and your peace of mind in the long term.

A charter is not a barrier, it's a framework that allows your community to express themselves freely with mutual respect.

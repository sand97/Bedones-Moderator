## Why Comments Are the Hidden Lever of Your African Campaigns

In Côte d'Ivoire (8.4M Facebook users) and Cameroon (6.17M), Facebook Ads generate 60-85% of e-commerce sales. But a high-performing campaign is not just creative and targeting: **comments directly influence your cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rate**.

**African reality**: 78% of prospects read comments before buying. A clean, responsive thread increases trust, reduces objections, and turns hesitant prospects into customers.

**Real case - Abidjan fashion shop**:
- Campaign 1 (without active moderation):
  - Budget: 450,000 CFA
  - Comments: 340 in 48h
  - Visible spam/scams: 23 (left 3-8h)
  - Unanswered questions: 67
  - Result: 18 sales, CPA = 25,000 CFA
- Campaign 2 (with real-time moderation):
  - Budget: 450,000 CFA
  - Comments: 360 in 48h
  - Spam/scams hidden: 19 (< 45 sec)
  - Questions answered: < 5 min
  - Result: 52 sales, CPA = 8,654 CFA
- **Improvement**: +189% sales, CPA reduced by 65%

## The Measurable Impact of Moderation on Your Ad Metrics

### Conversion rate (CTR → Purchase)

**Without active moderation**:
- 3-7% of clicks turn into sales
- Untreated objections = abandonment

**With fast moderation**:
- 12-22% of clicks convert
- Immediate reassurance = purchase decision

**Douala e-commerce example**:
- Ad budget: 680,000 CFA/month
- Before moderation: 840 clicks → 47 sales (5.6%)
- After moderation: 920 clicks → 186 sales (20.2%)
- **Ad ROI multiplied by 3.6**

### Cost per acquisition (CPA)

| Moderation type | Average CPA (Africa) | Conversion |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------|
| None | 18,000-35,000 CFA | 4-6% |
| Slow manual | 12,000-22,000 CFA | 8-11% |
| Fast automated | 6,000-12,000 CFA | 15-24% |

**CPA reduction = same budget, x2 to x3 sales.**

### Positive engagement rate

A clean thread encourages real questions and testimonials:
- Positive comments visible → bandwagon effect
- Spam hidden → serious conversation
- Fast replies → active community

**Yaoundé restaurant**:
- Menu launch campaign: 580,000 CFA
- With moderation: 73% positive comments, 147 reservations
- Without moderation (previous test): 41% positive, 58 reservations
- **Impact: +153% conversions**

## Before the Campaign: Preparation Checklist (Day -3 to Day -1)

### Day -3: Security and filters

**1. Keyword blacklist**:
- Direct competitors
- "WhatsApp", "number", "contact", "pay"
- "scam", "fake", "warning"
- Variations of your name (to block impersonation)

**2. Automatic filter configuration**:
- Comments with phone number → Quarantine
- External links → Automatic hiding
- Accounts created < 7 days + suspicious words → Moderator alert

**3. Validate official contacts**:

- HTTPS website

### Day -2: Content and FAQ

**4. FAQ for the 15 priority questions**:
- Exact price + options
- Delivery (covered cities, timelines, fees)
- Accepted payments (Mobile Money, cash, transfer)
- Available stock / out of stock
- Guarantee / return policy

**Abidjan electronics shop example**:
- Question #1 (32% of volume): "Delivery to Yopougon how much?"
- Pre-programmed answer: "Delivery Yopougon: 1,500 CFA, 24-48h. Order via WhatsApp +225 XX XX XX XX ✅"

**5. Pinned comment**:

"🔥 OFFICIAL LAUNCH!

Price: [X] CFA
📦 Delivery: Abidjan 1,500 CFA, inland 2,500 CFA
💳 Payment: Orange Money, MTN, cash

✅ Order: WhatsApp +225 XX XX XX XX
✅ Site: www.yourshop.com

⚠️ Warning: Beware of fake contacts in comments! Only the number in bio is official."

**6. "official channels" visuals**:
Image with logo + real contacts to share if confusion.

### Day -1: Team and tests

**7. Team brief (minimum 2 people)**:
- Person A: Comments and moderation
- Person B: Private messages and orders
- Fast decision protocol (< 2 min)

**8. Simulation test**:
- Post fake scam comment
- Verify detection/hiding
- Time response
- Target: < 60 seconds

**9. Quick replies configured**:
Templates on iOS/Android to reply in 1 click.

## During the Campaign: Minute-by-Minute Protocol

### Hours 0-2 (CRITICAL phase)

**Minute 0**:
- Publish the ad
- Pin the official comment immediately

**Minutes 1-15**:
- Like/reply to the first 10 positive comments
- Sets the tone and encourages healthy engagement

**Minutes 15-120**:
- Check ALL new comments
- Hide spam/links in < 60 seconds
- Answer questions in < 3 minutes

**Golden rule**: First fake contact visible > 5 min = 15-30 potential victims.

**Catastrophic case - Douala smartphone**:
- Campaign 950,000 CFA
- Fake WhatsApp posted minute 8, hidden minute 45 (37 min visible)
- 52 people contacted the fake number
- 14 paid → Total scam ~3.2M CFA
- Reputation destroyed, campaign failed

**Successful case - Abidjan cosmetics**:
- Campaign 720,000 CFA
- 18 scam attempts detected
- All hidden in < 50 seconds
- Result: 0 victim, 163 sales, ROI 380%

### Hours 3-24 (Active monitoring)

**Check every 20-30 min**:
- New suspicious comments
- Urgent purchase questions
- Creative scam variants

**Prioritize replies**:
1. Ready-to-buy questions (< 3 min)
2. Doubts/objections (< 10 min)
3. Compliments (< 30 min)

### Hours 24-72 (Maintenance)

**Check every 2-3h**:
Volume drops but vigilance is necessary.

## After the Campaign: Analysis and Optimization

### Day +1: Detailed report

**Metrics to extract**:
1. Total number of comments
2. Spam/scams detected and hidden
3. Questions asked (by category)
4. Average response time
5. Conversion rate comment → sale

**Numbered case - Yaoundé e-commerce**:
- Budget: 880,000 CFA
- Comments: 547
- Spam hidden: 31 (in < 90 sec)
- Questions: 214 (replies < 5 min)
- Sales from comments: 89 (41.6% conversion)
- CPA: 9,888 CFA

**Comparison with previous campaign (without moderation)**:
- Budget: 880,000 CFA
- Sales: 34
- CPA: 25,882 CFA

**Gain**: +162% sales, CPA reduced 62%

### Days +2 to +7: Continuous optimization

**1. Enrich FAQ**:
Add unplanned questions that generated conversions.

**Example**:
- Unexpected question: "Compatible with iPhone 13?"
- Generated 8 sales
- Added to FAQ for next campaign

**2. Adjust ad creatives**:
If 40% of comments ask for missing info → add it to the visual.

**Douala restaurant**:
- 35% comments: "Vegetarian menu available?"
- Next campaign: Added "Veg options ✅" to the visual
- Reduced repetitive questions by 35% → More time for real sales

**3. Update blacklist**:
New scam variants detected.

**4. Transparency post**:
"Thank you for your trust! ⚠️ We blocked 31 scam attempts during this campaign to protect you."

→ Reinforces trust + educates the community.

## The 7 Errors That Blow Up Your CPA

### 1. Leaving scams/spam visible > 5 min

**Impact**: -40 to -70% conversions
**Cost**: Reputation + lost sales + scammed customers blaming you

### 2. Answering questions after 30 minutes

**African reality**: Impatient prospects contact a competitor in 15-20 min.
**Loss**: 65% of prospects not answered quickly buy elsewhere.

### 3. Ignoring delivery questions

**Statistic**: 47% of African comments are about delivery/payment.
Ignoring = signal "I'm not serious".

### 4. No pinned comment with official contacts

**Result**: Confusion, repetitive questions, easier scams.

### 5. Not removing malicious negative reviews

**Difference**:
- Legitimate criticism → Respond publicly, resolve
- Competitor attack → Hide + report

**Fake review example**:
"Scam! Never received my order. Go to [competitor]."
→ Account created 3 days ago, 0 activity = obvious fake.

### 6. Inconsistent moderation (strict then lax)

**Problem**: Community loses trust, doesn't know what to post anymore.

### 7. No post-campaign analysis

**Loss**: Repeat the same errors, don't capitalize on what works.

## Metrics You Must Track

| Metric | Target | Alert if |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Spam hide time | < 60 sec | > 3 min |
| Question response time | < 5 min | > 15 min |
| Comment conversion rate | > 15% | < 8% |
| CPA | < 12,000 CFA | > 20,000 CFA |
| % spam missed | < 2% | > 10% |

**Benchmark for well-managed African campaigns**:
- Comment conversion: 18-28%
- CPA: 6,000-12,000 CFA
- Spam hidden: > 95%

## How to Automate Intelligently

**Recommended hybrid model**:
- AI detects spam/scams → Automatic hiding
- AI categorizes questions → Suggested replies
- Human validates ambiguous cases
- Human handles final sales

**Advantages**:
- 24/7 responsiveness (< 30 sec)
- Total consistency
- Reduced cost vs 3 human moderators

**Transformation case - Abidjan e-commerce**:
- Before: 1 CM at 280K CFA/month, overwhelmed, 40% comments untreated
- After AI + CM: 45K CFA tool + 180K lighter CM = 225K total
- Result: 100% comments treated, sales +140%, CM less stressed

## Why Launches Attract Chaos in Africa

A product launch on social networks in Côte d'Ivoire or Cameroon can generate 500 to 2,000 comments in a few hours. Without organization, commercial questions go unanswered and spam/scams take over.

**Alarming statistic**: 62% of African launches lose more than 40% of their sales potential due to insufficient moderation.

**Real case - Abidjan smartphone launch**:
- Sponsored post: 850 comments in 3h
- Without prepared moderation: 15% visible spam, 70% questions unanswered
- Result: Only 47 sales vs 280 planned
- Loss: 5.8 million CFA in unrealized revenue

## Before the Launch: 72 Hours of Critical Preparation

### Day -3: Audit and configuration

**1. Analyze your previous launches** (if applicable):
- Which questions came up most?
- What spam did you receive?
- What comment volume is expected?

**2. Prepare your launch FAQ** (10-15 answers):
- Price and payment options (Orange Money, MTN, Wave)
- Availability and stock
- Delivery terms by city
- Product features
- Differences vs competitors
- Guarantees and customer service

**Example - Douala cosmetics launch**:

Prepared FAQ:
1. "Price: 12,500 CFA with free delivery in Douala"
2. "Payment: Orange Money, MTN, cash on delivery"
3. "Delivery: 24h Douala, 48-72h other cities"
4. "100% natural, dermatologist-tested, no parabens"
5. "14-day satisfaction guarantee"

### Day -2: Moderation rules and filters

**3. Configure a blacklist of words**:
- Competitor names
- "scam", "fake", "copy"
- Shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl)
- Fake WhatsApp/Mobile Money numbers

**4. Create automatic rules**:
- Any external link → Quarantine
- Price/availability questions → Immediate auto reply
- Insults/spam → Automatic hiding

**5. Publish launch charter** in highlight story:
"🚨 ATTENTION: We NEVER ask for payment in comments. Our only contacts: WhatsApp [link] and website [link]. Report any spam."

### Day -1: Testing and mobilization

**6. Test the system**:
- Simulate 10-15 typical comments
- Verify auto replies are triggered
- Validate filters work

**7. Prepare your team**:
- Briefing on FAQ and process
- Define who handles what (comments vs DM vs WhatsApp)
- Prepare quick reply templates

**8. Create a pinned comment**:

"🎉 OFFICIAL LAUNCH! Price: 12,500 CFA. Order ONLY via:
✅ WhatsApp: [link]
✅ Website: [link]
⚠️ Beware of fake contacts in comments. Happy shopping! 🛍️"

## During the Launch: Hour-by-Hour Protocol

### Hour 0 (publication): Secure immediately

**Minutes 0-5**:
1. Publish the post with visuals + full description
2. Pin the official comment (prepared Day -1)
3. Enable push notifications on phone
4. Start the boost/sponsoring

**Expected result**: Clean base to start.

### Hours 1-3: Traffic peak - Maximum responsiveness

**Priority 1: Commercial questions (handle in < 2 min)**
- "How much is it?" → Auto price reply
- "How to order?" → WhatsApp + website
- "Do you deliver to [city]?" → Yes/No + timeline + fee

**Priority 2: Hide spam (< 30 sec)**
- Suspicious links → Hide + block account
- Fake numbers → Delete + report
- Competitor insults → Hide

**Priority 3: Enthusiasm and social proof**
- Like positive comments
- Reply with emojis to compliments
- Highlight customer reviews

**Fatal mistake to avoid**:
Leaving a spam/scam visible for 10+ minutes → Can kill 30% of your conversions.

**Avoided case - Abidjan e-commerce**:
Fake comment "Fake product, I was scammed!" posted minute 12, hidden minute 45 → 23 people had already seen it and left.
Estimated loss: 850,000 CFA.

### Hours 4-12: Maintain and convert

**Routine every 30 minutes**:
1. Reply to the last 10 comments
2. Hide new spam (usually 3-5/hour)
3. DM follow-up with "interested but hesitant" users

**Turn comments into sales**:

Comment: "I'm hesitating between red and black 🤔"
→ Reply: "Both are great! Red = bold, Black = classic. Need help? WhatsApp [link] for personalized advice 😊"

### Hours 12-24: Capitalize

**End of day**:
- Compile top 10 unplanned questions
- Add them to the automatic FAQ
- Identify hot leads for Day +1 follow-up

## After the Launch: Turn the Test Into Results

### Day +1: Analysis and follow-up

**1. Generate a performance report**:
- Total number of comments
- Average response time
- Conversion rate (comments → sales)
- Volume of hidden spam

**2. Follow up hot prospects**:
Anyone who asked 2+ questions without buying:
"Hello! Following your interest yesterday, our launch offer is still valid for 24h. Any questions? 😊"

### Day +2 to Day +7: FAQ capitalization

**3. Enrich your automatic reply base**:
- Add 10-15 new frequent questions
- Refine triggers that missed
- Remove replies that were not used

**4. Recap post for FOMO**:
"🔥 Already 147 orders in 48h! Limited stock. Last hours: [link]"
→ Creates urgency and social proof.

**5. Public thanks**:
Share customer testimonials in story/post:
"Thanks Marie-Claire from Yopougon for your trust! Delivery scheduled for tomorrow 🚚"

### Week 2: Make it sustainable

**6. Create evergreen content**:
- Product usage tutorial
- Full FAQ in a blog article
- Unboxing/demo video

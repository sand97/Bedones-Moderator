## Why Hate Speech is a Major Risk in Africa

In Côte d'Ivoire with 8.4 million Facebook users and Cameroon with 6.17 million, hate speech (ethnic, religious, regional) is particularly sensitive. This content hurts your community, exposes your page to reports, and can lead to legal sanctions up to 5 million CFA fine + page closure.

**Specific African Context**: Ethnic and regional tensions make certain words/expressions ultra-sensitive. What seems harmless can trigger massive controversy.

**Real Case - Cultural Page Abidjan (22K)**:
- Offensive ethnic comment under post about traditions
- Visible 6h before hiding
- Result: 340+ reports, page suspended 15 days, loss of 2 partnerships
- Loss: 950,000 CFA + damaged reputation 3 months

**CI Legal Obligation 2026**: Removal within 24-48h or liability engaged.

## Define a Clear and Nuanced Policy

### Basic Principle: Zero Tolerance for Hate, Openness to Criticism

**What is PROHIBITED** (immediate deletion):
- Insults targeting ethnic origin, religion, region
- Physical violence threats
- Dehumanizing remarks ("they are animals", etc.)
- Hateful generalizing stereotypes
- Calls for discrimination or exclusion

**What is ALLOWED** (even if negative):
- Reasoned criticism of practices/policies
- Respectfully expressed disagreement
- Questions even clumsy but sincere
- Constructive contradictory debate

**Example - Fine Line**:
❌ "The [ethnic X] are all thieves" → Deletion (hateful generalization)
✅ "I didn't appreciate this person's attitude" → Allowed (individual criticism)

### The Critical Importance of African Context

The same word can be:
- **Offensive** depending on target (ethnicity, region, religion)
- **Neutral** in another context
- **Affectionate** between members of same communities

**Real Côte d'Ivoire Example**:
- Word "foreigner": Can be neutral OR very offensive depending on political/social context
- Local nouchi expression: Sometimes vulgar for outsiders, neutral for Abidjan residents

**Absolute Necessity**: Moderators must know local cultural nuances.

## 4-Step Workflow: AI + Human

### Step 1: Automatic Risk Detection (AI)

**Sensitive Keywords by Country**:
- Ethnic terms to monitor (CI, Cameroon, Senegal)
- Polarizing religious references
- Offensive regional expressions

**Automatic Scoring**:
- High risk (score 8-10/10) → Immediate quarantine
- Medium risk (5-7/10) → Moderator alert
- Low risk (< 5/10) → Publication

### Step 2: Quarantine Ambiguous Cases (< 30 sec)

Comment detected as sensitive = temporarily hidden pending human analysis.

**Advantage**: Limits propagation during investigation (10-60 min).

### Step 3: Fast Human Review by Local Moderator (< 2h)

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Does the comment target a specific group?
2. Is there negative generalization?
3. Is the tone aggressive or reasoned?
4. Does context change the meaning?
5. Does author have history of hate speech?

**Practical Case - Douala Restaurant**:
- Comment: "People from [neighborhood X] never pay their bills"
- AI: Score 7/10 (medium risk)
- Human analyzes: Negative generalization based on geographical origin
- Decision: Hide + private response explaining why

### Step 4: Documented Decision with Clear Reason

Each action must be logged:
- Date/time
- Concerned comment (screenshot)
- AI score
- Human decision (publish/hide/delete/block)
- Specific reason

**Usefulness**: Proof of diligence if ARTCI audit or dispute.

## Transparency with the Community

### Publish Visible Anti-Hate Charter

**Africa-Adapted Example**:
"Respect Rules:
✅ Open debate, reasoned criticism
❌ Ethnic, regional, religious insults
❌ Threats, dehumanizing remarks
❌ Hateful generalization

Fast moderation to protect everyone. Thank you! 🙏"

### Regular Reminders in Pinned Comment

Under sensitive posts (politics, social, cultural), pin:
"Reminder: Respect is mandatory. Hate speech will be deleted. Let's debate with mutual respect."

### Educate Rather Than Just Sanction

**Borderline Case**: Respond BEFORE deleting

Example:
Comment: "All [group X] think the same"
Response: "Careful, this type of generalization is offensive and against our charter. Please rephrase respectfully."

→ 60% of cases: Person apologizes and rephrases.

## How AI Can Help Without Blind Censorship

### AI = Detection and Sorting, NOT Final Decision

**Recommended Model**:
- AI detects 95% of potentially hateful content
- AI classifies by risk level
- Human decides on ambiguous cases (15-25% of volume)
- AI learns from human decisions

**Advantages**:
- Reactivity: Detection in < 10 seconds
- Consistency: Same criteria 24/7
- Scalability: Handles high volumes
- Safety: Human avoids excessive censorship

**Case Avoided - Tech Influencer Dakar (38K)**:
- AI detects 15-20 sensitive comments/week
- Human validates 12-15 deletions (truly hateful)
- 3-5 false positives put back online
- Result: Clean page + zero over-censorship + zero dispute

## Metrics to Track Monthly

1. **Number of hateful content detected**
2. **Average processing time**
3. **False positive rate** (wrongly hidden content)
4. **False negative rate** (escaped hate)
5. **Number of reports received**

**Healthy Targets**:
- Time < 2h
- False positives < 8%
- False negatives < 3%
- Reports < 5/month

## How AI Can Help Without Censoring

AI classifies comments by severity and lets humans decide on borderline cases. It's a balance between safety and freedom of expression.

## Why a Crisis Spreads So Fast in Africa

In Côte d'Ivoire with 8.4 million Facebook users and Cameroon with 6.17 million, a bad buzz can reach 50,000+ people in less than 2 hours. African social networks are particularly reactive and emotional.

**African spread speed**: 3x faster than in Europe thanks to WhatsApp and viral sharing.

**Real case - Abidjan restaurant 2025**:
- 14h: Unhappy customer posts video "cockroach in my dish"
- 14h45: 1,200 views, 87 shares, 143 negative comments
- 16h: Blog article "Top 5 restaurants to avoid in Abidjan" + video in #1
- 18h: -2,000 followers, reservations canceled for the week
- Loss: ~4.5 million CFA + 6 months to repair image

Without a plan, negative comments multiply, rumors take over and the brand loses control.

## Before the Crisis: 4 Preparations That Save You

### 1. Documented crisis plan (ready template)

Create a "Bad buzz protocol" document containing:
- Emergency numbers list (manager, lawyer, PR agency)
- Message templates by crisis type
- Communication validation process
- List of media/influencers to contact

**Keep it accessible 24/7** (Google Doc, Notion).

### 2. Clear, visible comment charter

Published in a permanent story + pinned.
Makes legitimate removal of toxic content easier.

### 3. Official emergency channel

**Verified WhatsApp Business** for crises:
- Avoids public exchanges that escalate
- Enables confidential resolution
- Preserves evidence of exchanges

**Crisis email**: contact-urgent@yourbrand.com

### 4. Identified crisis cell

Minimum 2 people with:
- Full page access
- Decision power
- Phone availability 24/7

**Test the protocol** every 6 months with a simulation.

## The 60-Minute Plan: Timed and Tested

### Minute 0-5: Detection and alert (CRITICAL)

**How to detect quickly**:
- Push notifications enabled
- Keyword monitoring: "scam", "disappointed", "horrible", "cockroach", "food poisoning"
- Alert if sudden spike in negative comments

**First action**:
1. Read the issue in full
2. Capture screenshots
3. Alert crisis cell (call + WhatsApp)

⏱️ **Goal**: Team mobilized in < 5 min.

### Minute 5-15: Immediate securing

**1. Hide dangerous toxic content**
- Racist/sexist insults → Delete
- Threats → Delete + report
- Spam exploiting the crisis → Hide

**⚠️ Do NOT hide**:
- The original complaint (Streisand effect)
- Legitimate criticism
- Questions from worried customers

**2. Identify impact and severity**

**Level 1 - Minor**:
- 1 isolated unhappy customer
- < 20 negative comments
- No viral shares
→ Standard management

**Level 2 - Moderate**:
- 20-100 negative comments
- Shares starting
- Local influencers begin relaying
→ Apply 60-minute plan

**Level 3 - Major**:
- > 100 comments
- Press/blog articles
- Negative hashtag trending
→ 60-minute plan + PR agency + possibly lawyer

**3. Stabilize with acknowledgement comment**

**Pin immediately**:

"We have noted the reported situation. We take this very seriously and are currently investigating. First response within 30 minutes. Thank you for your patience."

⏱️ **Goal**: Secured space in < 15 min.

### Minute 15-30: Express investigation and first public message

**1. Verify the facts internally**
- Question the team involved
- Check order/customer file
- Gather evidence (photos, receipts, invoices)

**2. Determine your position**

**If you are at fault**:
- Acknowledge honestly
- Offer sincere apologies
- Propose a concrete solution

**If the complaint is unfounded**:
- Stay factual and calm
- Provide proof politely
- Offer private dialogue

**If the situation is unclear**:
- Buy time to investigate
- Remain empathetic
- Promise transparency

**3. Draft official public message**

**Template if you are at fault**:

"Following the issue reported today, we investigated urgently.

[Client name] is right: [factual summary of the problem].

This is unacceptable and we are deeply sorry.

Immediate actions:
✅ [Solution for the client]
✅ [General corrective measure]
✅ [Guarantee it won't happen again]

We will contact [client name] privately within the hour. For any questions: WhatsApp [link].

Thank you for your understanding."

**What works**:
- Clear acknowledgment
- No weak excuses
- Concrete actions
- Precise timeline

⏱️ **Goal**: Public message in < 30 min.

### Minute 30-45: Private contact with the person concerned

**WhatsApp/phone call** (not SMS, not comment):

1. **Listen** first without interrupting (5 min)
2. **Offer personalized apologies**
3. **Propose a solution**:
   - Full refund
   - Free replacement product/service
   - Significant goodwill gesture (not a ridiculous 10% discount)
4. **Ask** (politely) for a public update if resolved

**Example**:
"Hello [name], I'm [your name], manager of [brand]. I'm calling about your unacceptable experience today. I'm truly sorry..."

**Goal**: Turn a detractor into an ambassador.

**Successful case - Douala boutique**:
Angry customer (dress received torn):
- Call within 20 min
- Apologies + refund + new dress offered + 50,000 CFA voucher
- Customer posted: "I was wrong to get angry. Problem solved in 1h, exceptional customer service!"
- Crisis avoided, reputation strengthened.

### Minute 45-60: FAQ and redirection

**1. Compile recurring questions** from comments:
- "Does this happen often?"
- "What will you do?"
- "Is it safe to order?"

**2. Create mini-FAQ** (3-5 Q&A):

**Q: Are your products safe?**
R: Yes, this isolated incident was caused by [reason]. We have [corrective action]. Out of 12,000 orders in 2025, satisfaction rate is 97%.

**Q: How can we be sure it won't happen again?**
R: We have implemented [concrete measures]. Quality control reinforced starting today.

**3. Redirect to official channel**

"For any concern, contact us:
- WhatsApp: [link]
- Email: [email]

We respond in < 1h."

⏱️ **Goal**: FAQ + channel in place in < 60 min.

## After 60 Minutes: Consolidate and Prevent

### H+2 to H+24: Continuous communication

**Every 2-3h**, update the situation:
- "Update 18h: [client] satisfied with the solution. Corrective measures in progress."
- Instagram story showing concrete actions

**Respond to ALL comments**:
- Positive: "Thanks for your support!"
- Constructive negative: "Thanks, noted for improvement"
- Trolls: Hide if insulting, ignore if just negative

### Day +1: Internal post-mortem

**1-hour meeting**:
1. What triggered the crisis?
2. How to prevent it in the future?
3. What worked/failed in our response?
4. Which procedures should be updated?

**Document** everything for future training.

### Day +7: Image rebuilding

**Positive content**:
- Satisfied customer testimonials
- Behind-the-scenes quality/fabrication
- Brand values

**Local influencers**:
Invite 2-3 micro-influencers to test products/services → Authentic positive content.

## Message Templates by Crisis Type

### Customer service crisis

"Our employee's behavior was unacceptable. The person has been sanctioned and is undergoing training. We contacted [client] and found a solution. Our sincerest apologies."

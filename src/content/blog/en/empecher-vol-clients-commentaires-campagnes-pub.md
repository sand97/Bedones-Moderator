## Why African Campaigns Massively Attract Hijacking

In Ivory Coast and Cameroon, sponsored Facebook/Instagram campaigns generate 60-85% of e-commerce sales. But they also attract professional scammers who steal your prospects in real time.

**Scale of the problem**: 58% of African campaigns experience at least one hijacking attempt.

**Catastrophic case - Abidjan Smartphone Launch**:
- Ad budget: 850,000 CFA, 1,240 comments in 48h
- Without protection: 47 fake WhatsApp contacts posted, 180+ people contacted
- Result: 23 successful scams (customers paid scammers), 67 lost sales
- Total loss: Scams (5.75M CFA customers) + Lost sales (3.35M CFA) + Reputation
- Long-term impact: 4 months to restore trust

**With real-time moderation**: 98% of attempts blocked in < 45 seconds.

## The 7 Most Common Theft Techniques in Africa

### 1. Brand Identity Theft (65% of cases)

**Technique**: Create fake account "Your_Brand_Official" and post fraudulent WhatsApp number.

**Real example**:
- Real brand: "BeautyCosmetics"
- Fake account: "BeautyCosmetic_Officiel" (without s)
- Comment: "To order quickly: WhatsApp +225 XX XX XX XX ✅"
- 34 people contact → 12 pay → Scam

**Protection**: Report and block in < 2 min.

### 2. Links to Clone Sites (22%)

Fake site identical to yours, attractive prices, stolen payment.

**Detection**: Any external link = suspect.

### 3. Redirect to Direct Competitor (8%)

**Typical comment**: "At [competitor] it's cheaper and better quality. Check out their page."

**Impact**: Seeds doubt + loss of prospects.

### 4. Fake Urgent Promos (15%)

"FLASH PROMO 50%! Only 10 spots, pay now to this number..."

**Trap**: Creates artificial urgency to push quick payment.

### 5. "Go to inbox" Request for Private Scam (18%)

"Write me privately I'll explain how to get special discount..."

→ Privately, impersonates you and requests payment.

### 6. Customer Theft via "Grouped" Offer (7%)

"I'm grouping orders to reduce delivery costs. Send money to my account..."

→ Steals money from 10-20 people and disappears.

### 7. Fake Negative Testimonials to Redirect (5%)

"Scam! I ordered and received nothing. Go to [competitor] instead."

→ Destroys trust + redirects elsewhere.

## Pricing Model Recommendation

### Why Hybrid Subscription + Credits?

**Rationale:**
1. **Legal compliance is non-negotiable** → Subscription ensures continuous protection
2. **Usage varies dramatically** → Credits handle viral posts (10 comments vs 1,000)
3. **Predictable recurring revenue** → Essential for SaaS sustainability
4. **Proven in African market** → Selar uses subscriptions + transaction fees successfully
5. **Customer flexibility** → Pay for base + scale as needed

**Alternative Models Considered:**
- ❌ **Credits-only**: No predictable revenue, customers may lapse protection
- ❌ **Unlimited subscription**: Can't scale profitably with viral content
- ✅ **Hybrid**: Best of both worlds

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Payment Integration Complexity

**Risk:** African payment providers vary widely in reliability, documentation, and integration difficulty.

**Impact:** High - Can block entire market entry

**Mitigation:**
- Start with best-documented providers (Paystack, Flutterwave)
- Build abstraction layer for multiple providers
- Use aggregators like CinetPay where possible
- Have backup payment options per country
- Allocate 2-3 weeks for payment testing per integration

---

### Risk 2: Currency Fluctuations

**Risk:** Local currencies (especially Naira, CFA franc) can be volatile vs USD

**Impact:** Medium - Can erode margins

**Mitigation:**
- Price in local currency (customers understand)
- Review pricing quarterly and adjust if needed
- Use payment processors that handle FX risk
- Consider USD pricing for high-value customers
- Build 10-15% FX buffer into pricing

---

### Risk 3: Regulatory Changes

**Risk:** Laws could change, become more/less strict, or not be enforced

**Impact:** High - Core value proposition depends on legal risk

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor legal developments in each country
- Diversify across multiple markets
- Position as "general moderation tool" not just legal compliance
- Add features beyond legal compliance (community management, analytics)
- Build relationships with legal experts for early warnings

---

### Risk 4: AI Model Failures

**Risk:** AI models may have accuracy issues with African languages, dialects, cultural context

**Impact:** High - False positives annoy customers, false negatives create legal risk

**Mitigation:**
- Human review option for flagged content
- Continuous model improvement with customer feedback
- Confidence scores (let users set threshold)
- Detailed explanations for flagged content
- Fallback to multiple models (Gemini + Grok)
- Local language training data collection

---

### Risk 5: Competition from Meta/Facebook

**Risk:** Facebook could build native moderation tools

**Impact:** Medium - Would be free, but also generic

**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage and brand building
- Country-specific legal expertise (Meta won't customize per African country)
- Better mobile money integration
- Superior customer support (local, responsive)
- Platform-agnostic (works across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)

---

### Risk 6: Low Awareness of Legal Risk

**Risk:** Influencers may not know about liability laws or care

**Impact:** Medium - Makes customer acquisition harder

**Mitigation:**
- Education-first marketing approach
- Partner with legal experts for credibility
- Free tools (legal compliance checklist)
- PR around enforcement cases (when influencers get arrested/fined)
- Testimonials from respected influencers
- ROI calculator: Cost of fine vs cost of protection

---

### Risk 7: Customer Churn

**Risk:** Customers may stop paying after initial scare passes

**Impact:** Medium - Affects LTV and growth

**Mitigation:**
- Annual billing with discount (lock in for 12 months)
- Continuous value delivery (monthly reports, insights)
- Community and education (keep legal awareness high)
- Add features beyond compliance (engagement analytics, sentiment analysis)
- Lapsed customer win-back campaigns
- Strong onboarding to demonstrate value early

---

### Risk 8: Scale Challenges

**Risk:** Growing too fast could strain operations, support, infrastructure

**Impact:** Medium - Could hurt customer experience

**Mitigation:**
- Gradual country-by-country expansion
- Automate everything possible (onboarding, support, billing)
- Build scalable infrastructure from day 1 (Cloudflare Workers)
- Hire part-time support in each market early
- Document processes for repeatability
- Monitoring and alerting for technical issues
